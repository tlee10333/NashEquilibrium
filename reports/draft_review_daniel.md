### Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

The team is using a 1D binary cellular automaton rule to simulate traffic and find out differenet thresholds in the model, such as the theshold the model becomes jammed or reaches "speed 1" which allows all of the "cars" to move freely wihtout being blocked. 

### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

I understand the methodology, but I was curiopus as to how the "traffic jams" are being quantified. Essentially, what is stop time and how is it calculated? I can make a well-reasoned assumption as to what it is, but I think it would be helpful to state it explicitly. But the methodlogy does answer the questions nicely.

### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

I understand what the results are and the graphs are clean and useful for visualizing the findings. Pehaps putting a figure caption would be useful, but that's just a small detail.

### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

There isn't a lot to really interpret, seeing as the result is a single value (density). I think expanding on this section:

"As the density increases, the time it takes to jam decreases less from its neighbor, and the distribution of the trials becomes smaller. As the graph exhibits a long-tailed distribution, we also plot our results on a log-log scale, yielding a somewhat linear line."

would help to create more of an interpreation. Keep in mind, your interpretation doesn't have to be 100% right. Just provide your thoughts as to why you think that density is the critical threshold. 

### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?

The results seem to be consisent with that of the original paper, at least from the authors claim that they are "consistent with the findings in Nagataniâ€™s paper". It's a quantitative comparison so I understand why not much emphasis was placed on it.

### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

The extension is clear and does answer a fun question not originally adressed. Once again, maybe  afigure caption could be added. 

### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

I'd say this team is where they need to be. Nice work!

### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide

It all looks copacetic, clear, and clean.

### Links to an external site.?

Yes, and they work.

### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

The directory formatting is well done and the meaningful title, author names, and bibliography are included.
